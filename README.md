# MultiModalityFakeNews
Comparison of Algorithms, Augmentation and Multimodality

## Setting up the code
1. Increase python version 3.9 in the system
2. Navigate to project directory and run "pip install -r requirements.txt"
3. Initialize the jupyter notebook using "python -m notebook"

### Running Multi Modality Fake News Code
1. Find multimodalityfakenews.ipynb in the resulting browser window and open it in the notebook window.
2. To just test the working of the code use the training and val sizes as 500 and 50 respectively for faster computation. If accuracy is the goal increase the train size to 50000 and validation size to 5000. This can be done by tuning the variables TRAIN_SIZE and VAL_SIZE
3. Run cell by cell to train the model and test the accuracy.
